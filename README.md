# Re-do Tutorial about Devise 7 publish at DigitalOcean
The initial publish may be found here:
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-user-authentication-with-devise-in-a-rails-7-application

I am not suggest to you to do the ocean tutorial in develop or production mode.
Try a new project first, and take your own conclusion.

### What I did?

- Step 1 — Creating a New Rails Application

    You can follow. It works fine.
- Step 2 — Creating a Landing Page

    Don't do like their tutorial, because it is not in the best practice of rails.
    Create a controller using `$ rails g controller Home` or `$ rails generate scaffold Home`
